TIER NAME CONVENTIONS

Morphologically annotated files in DoReCo contain up to 8 core tiers and 2 supplementary tiers, in addition to the other tiers present in the files.

Core tiers
	ref: Reference ID for tx units; generated by DoReCo
	tx: Transcription of chunks of speech, separated by corpus creators based on a variety of criteria (syntactic, prosodic, semantic, or pragmatic)
	ft: Free translation of the tx tier into a widely spoken language
	wd: Word unit
	mb: Morph unit
	gl: Morphematic gloss of morph unit
	ps: Part of speech category; can be of the word unit or the morph unit, depending on the dataset
	ph: phone unit (in X-SAMPA format)

Supplementary tiers
	doreco-mb-algn: Units indicate a morpheme boundary which the alignment algorithm was not able to confidently assign to a phoneme boundary; helpful for filtering out such cases
	mc-zero: Only present in MultiCAST corpora; units contain two kinds of information which could not be assigned to a phone: 1) clause boundaries and 2) zero words; the contents of the mb/gl/ps tiers are separated by spaces ' ', and multiple adjacent units are further separated by pipes '|'
	refind and isnref: Only present in MultiCAST corpora; identification of referents following Schiborr, Nils N. & Schnell, Stefan & Thiele, Hanna. 2018. RefIND â€” Referent Indexing in Natural-language Discourse: Annotation guidelines. Version 1.1. (https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/data/pubs/refind/Schiborr+etal2018_RefIND-guidelines_v1.1.pdf)

LABELLING CONVENTIONS USED IN TRANSCRIPTIONS FOR NON-ALIGNED ELEMENTS

The word (wd@...) and phone (ph@...) tiers in DoReCo annotation files sometimes contain elements in angle brackets referred to as labels (see below for a full list). There were two main motivations for using labels in DoReCo. First, they help identify exceptional speech events such as disfluencies or filled pauses that users should be aware of, e.g. in case they wish to exclude them from subsequent studies. Second, labels replace time-alignment at the phone or morpheme level. This makes the alignments overall more consistent, and ensures that grapheme-to-phoneme rules (see doreco_[glottocode]_transcription-conventions.csv) only include phonologically relevant mappings.

Filled pause	<<fp>>
False start	<<fs>>
Prolongation	<<pr>>
Foreign material	<<fm>>
Singing		<<sg>>
Backchannel		<<bc>>
Ideophone		<<id>>
Onomatopoeic		<<on>>
Word-internal pause	<<wip>>
Unidentifiable	<<ui>>
Silent pause	<p:>

Labels consist of two opening brackets, the label proper, a closing bracket, the content (optional), and another closing bracket, e.g. <<ui>word>. Labels may also appear on their own if the content is not known, e.g. <<ui>>. Silent pauses are marked by a special symbol, <p:>. The location of silent pauses is manually checked by the DoReCo team, while the symbol itself is inserted by the WebMAUS service. Unlike the other labels, the <p:> symbol has only one of each bracket, and no other content may be included in it.

MORPHEME TYPE AND MORPHEME BREAK CONVENTIONS

The following conventions are used on the mb (morph unit) and gl (morphematic gloss of morph unit) tiers to indicate morpheme types and morpheme breaks:

root
-suffix
prefix-
-infix-
=enclitic
proclitic=
~reduplicant (as a suffix)
reduplicant~ (as a prefix)
-reduplicant~- (infixing reduplication)
-~reduplicant- (infixing reduplication)

WORD COUNT METHOD

Word counts reported in the metadata and on https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages were calculated as follows: In the "*_wd.csv" files (tabular output of data with one row per word), we counted all rows in which the "wd" column was not empty, did not contain bracketed or parenthetical material, and did contain alphanumerical content; finally, we subtracted <<wip>> rows to account for word-internal pauses. Note that individual core files may have a higher number of words when counted as part of the extended set because they may contain text by additional speakers that are not time-aligned and thus not counted as part of the core set.
